Testing field for Tcl Scripts with Gtk+ as Tk

In the Wiki there is documentation for the attempt to port gnocl to Snow
Leopard 10.6 relying on Gtk-Macosx which is bound to the Quartz theme
(Aqua).

In the download section you will find the gnocl.dylib dynamic library for MacOSX and a modified pkgIndex.tcl.
Most of the gnocl commands are working, just try "gnocl::window".

But the Mac style menubar is still in work.

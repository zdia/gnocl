Porting gnocl to MacOSX

For Linux systems we have not only Tcl/Tk but - using the Gnocl library - Tcl/Gtk+, too . Gnocl is a stable and well documented extension, see www.gnocl.org.

As Gtk is a cross platform GUI so why not try to port Gnocl to MacOSX since there is a native implementation of Gtk-2.0 for MacOSX with gtk-osx (see http://gtk-osx.sourceforge.net/)? The drawing routines are bound to the Quartz library which is the base for Aqua.

In the Wiki there is documentation for the attempt to port gnocl to Snow
Leopard 10.6 relying on Gtk-Macosx which is bound to the Quartz theme
(Aqua).

Actual step: Integration of Mac application menu and menubar
Concerned files: osxmenu.c gnocl.c

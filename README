Gnocl implements a Tcl binding to the Gtk+ programming libraries for the
rapid development of graphical user interfaces. Also supported too are a
number of bindings to key resources and packages which build upon the
Gtk+ libraries such as the Gnome Applet Menu and Canvas widget. Designed
to work with Tcl in a manner consistent with the general syntax and
command naming conventions of Tcl, Gnocl provides a robust alternative
to Tk for those developers which wish to develop applications that
seamlessly integrated into the Gnome desktop environment without having
to first familiarize themselves with the intricacies of the Gtk+
libraries and its dependencies.

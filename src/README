Gnocl on MacOSX

Gtk+ is intended as a cross platform GUI and Tcl is a cross-platform computer
language so Tcl/Gtk would provide an effective partnership.

Gnocl is a package which binds Tcl to Gtk. It is available for Linux and
Windows but not for the MacOSX. For further information see: 
http://www.gnocl.org/

This project tries to port the Gnocl bindings to a native implementation
of Gtk-2.0 for MacOSX which is given by the gtk-osx project. 
See http://gtk-osx.sourceforge.net/

In gtk-osx project all the Gtk+ libraries are bound to the Quartz library
which is the base for Aqua. So no X11 server is needed any more and the
objects are drawn in an Aqua wise way.

In the Wiki there is documentation for the attempt to port gnocl to Snow
Leopard (10.6.2) 

Anyone who wants to commit to, fork or test this project is welcome.
